(1) I have rewritten the Makefile. To compile the program, simply type
        make

(2) main() file is dtcMain.c. I have encapsulated the GPIO. 
    To make, say GPIO 27, low, call function setGPIO in this form:
        setGPIO(27, LOW);
    Correspondingly,
        setGPIO(27, HIGH);
        
        
TODO:
    I will figure out interrupt maybe....
