(1) I have rewritten the Makefile. To compile the program, simply type
        make
    A file named kernel7.img will be generated, which is the kernel. Move this file to SD card and the Raspberry Pi 2/3 will boot.

(2) main() file is dtcMain.c. I have encapsulated the GPIO. 
    To make, say GPIO 27, low, call function setGPIO in this form:
        setGPIO(27, LOW);
    Correspondingly,
        setGPIO(27, HIGH);
        
        
TODO:
    I will figure out interrupt maybe....
